## Launch Your First Nginx Web Server on ECS Cluster in Default VPC
This guide provides a comprehensive overview of setting up and deploying an Nginx web server on ECS. If you have any specific configurations or requirements, you can adjust the steps accordingly.

## Step 1: Prerequisites
Before we begin, ensure you have the following:

    - An AWS account
    - AWS CLI installed and configured with your credentials
    - Docker installed on your local machine

# Step 2: Create an ECS Cluster
    - Login to AWS Management Console:
    - Go to the ECS Dashboard.
    - Create a Cluster:
    - Click on "Create Cluster".
    - Select "EC2 Linux + Networking" and click "Next Step".
    - Name your cluster (e.g., nginx-cluster).
    - For the instance type, select t3a.medium (or any other instance type as per your requirement).
    - Choose the number of instances you want to launch.
    - Click on "Create".

# Step 3: Create a Task Definition
    - Navigate to Task Definitions:
        - On the ECS Dashboard, click on "Task Definitions".
        - Click "Create new Task Definition"
    - Define Task Definition:
        - Select "EC2" and click "Next Step".
        - Give your task definition a name (e.g., nginx-task).
    - Add Container:
        - Click on "Add container".
        - Name the container (e.g., nginx).
        - For the image, use nginx:latest.
        - Set memory limits (e.g., 128 MiB soft limit).
        - Set port mappings: Host port and container port to 80.
        - Click "Add".
    - Save Task Definition:
        - Review your task definition settings.
        - Click "Create".

# Step 4: Create an ECS Service
    - Navigate to Services:
        - On the ECS Dashboard, click on your cluster (nginx-cluster).
        - Click on "Create".
    - Define Service:
        - Choose the launch type as EC2.
        - Name your service (e.g., nginx-service).
        - Select the task definition (nginx-task).
        - Set the number of tasks (desired count) to 1.
    - Configure Network:
        - In the Network configuration, select your default VPC.
        - Choose the subnets for your instances.
        - Select the security group that allows inbound traffic on port 80.
        - Assign a public IP if necessary.
    - Configure Load Balancer (Optional):
        - If you want to use a load balancer, create an ALB and configure it here.
        - Otherwise, you can skip this step for now.
    - Create Service:
        - Review your service settings.
        - Click "Create Service".

# Step 5: Verify the Deployment
    - Check ECS Cluster:
        - Go to the ECS Dashboard.
        - Click on your cluster (nginx-cluster).
        - Ensure the service is running and the task is in the RUNNING state.
    - Access Nginx Web Server:
        - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
        - Find the running EC2 instance for your ECS task.
        - Copy the public IP address of the instance.
        - Open a web browser and go to http://<public-ip>.
        - You should see the default Nginx welcome page.
# Step 6: Clean Up (Optional)
    - Delete Service:
        - Go to the ECS Dashboard.
        - Click on your cluster (nginx-cluster).
        - Select the service (nginx-service).
        - Click on "Delete" to remove the service.

    - Delete Cluster:
        - Go back to the ECS Dashboard.
        - Select your cluster (nginx-cluster).
        - Click on "Delete Cluster" to remove the cluster and associated resources.

Conclusion
You've successfully launched an Nginx web server on an ECS Cluster in the default VPC! This guide covered creating a cluster, task definition, and service, and accessing the running Nginx instance.

Feel free to expand this setup with additional configurations, such as integrating with an Application Load Balancer, adding more containers, or automating deployments using ECS Services.
